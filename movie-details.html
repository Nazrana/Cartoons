      <p>In the bustling city of Shanghai, a young boy named Li Na longs for a wish dragon to grant him any wish he desires. One day, while exploring an old antique shop, Li Na stumbles upon a dusty old teapot that is said to contain a wish dragon.

        Excited and curious, Li Na rubs the teapot and out pops a small, colorful dragon named Longwei. Longwei explains that he can grant Li Na three wishes, but there's a catch - the wishes must be used wisely and with good intentions.   <br>
        
        Li Na is overjoyed and quickly makes his first wish - to have all the money in the world. Suddenly, the streets of Shanghai are filled with piles of money, causing chaos and confusion among the people. Realizing his mistake, Li Na quickly makes his second wish - to undo the first wish and return everything to normal.
        
        For his final wish, Li Na selflessly wishes for happiness and prosperity for all the people of Shanghai. Longwei smiles and grants the wish, spreading joy and goodwill throughout the city. <br>
        
        As the sun sets on the city, Li Na bids farewell to Longwei, grateful for the lessons learned and the power of selfless wishes. And as he watches the wish dragon disappear into the sunset, Li Na knows that true happiness comes from helping others and making the world a better place.</p>
